Model-view-controller (MVC) is a software programming platform that is used in many different ways, and let me tell you: it’s the way to go. Its most popular form of use is web development.You can find an MVC platform for almost any programming language, from Python to .Net to Ruby on Rails. You name it, it’s there. That said, here’s what you need to know about MVC:

- **Preconfigured platform.** The MVC platform comes preconfigured with the logic and presentation layers separated for a better organized and more efficient application. This helps make the code more testable, which ultimately leads to a higher quality and more reliable product.
- **Less code to write.** Most developers write the same code over and over, repurposing it on different sites. MVC allows you to use code that’s already built-in, so all you have to do is reference the part of the code you want. That way, you can build the same application faster and with less code, which leads to quicker turnover.
- **URLs primed for SEO.** MVC frameworks tend to use some form of URL rerouting, offering ways to create clean custom URLs and even add special URL treatments per site or page. Cleaner URLs lead to better search engine optimization, and who doesn’t like that?
- **Serious flexibility.** MVC frameworks can be added to a directory of any existing site for things like custom-built blog engines. They also come set up with the ability to add new technology to the application, or add any third-party software you desire.
- **Can be used for any application.** MVC works for any site or application, big or small. There are no minimum requirements to make MVC a good idea: It’s always a good idea.

A lot of applications are currently powered by some sort of MVC framework, and I’m willing to bet that one exists for your language of choice. Microsoft is coming out with a MVC framework soon called ASP.Net MVC, so rest assured you’ll be seeing much more MVC in the future.
