			<p>This site emphasizes a pragmatic approach to faith and physical wellness with the sole intent to alleviate affliction and overcome life’s unavoidable setbacks. The ensuing discussions will focus on daily, simple application regarding optimal health and spirituality. Apokalupsis means revealing, or uncovering, similar to that of one removing a drab cover from one of da Vinci’s finest. The covering is only a temporary shroud, for beneath lay a masterpiece awaiting its revelation. Like the painting, every person is God’s masterpiece, and it is the responsibility of each to seek and unveil his/her unique purpose. It is my most sincere hope that you utilize this site for your journey to victory.</p>

			<p><em>Why</em> - My central intention for this blog is to be a source of encouragement for the reader. My wish is that this would be a place, not for lamenting, but for active engagement and musing discourse in practical precepts of both faith and health. Parenthetically, I hope to learn from you and your experiences, for I believe you each have something valuable to share.</p>
			<p><em>Faith and health</em> - Put simply: behavior follows faith. We are all people of faith, and this is the starting point of any endeavor. To be successful, faith must be placed into something substantive, satisfying, and tangible; namely, Jesus. Faith is therefore intimately related to one's physical health and the pursuits that follow. For example, if one should quit smoking he/she must find a reason, other than the mere sake of quitting, for success. Secondarily, I hope that, together, we can elucidate the conventional health misconceptions which permeate our culture, and avoid the malicious mantras unjustifiably established decades ago.</p>
			<p><em>Author</em> - I am a Christ follower. I am a Texan American. I am an Aggie. I love my family. I love rocks. I love exercise. I love cooking (Paleo foods). I love learning. I look forward with much anticipation and eagerness to assist you in any way I can manage. Thank you for reading, and thank you for participating.</p>
