		<h3>Living Balance Sheet</h3>
		<p><strong>Client:</strong> The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America</p>
		<p><strong>Technology:</strong> iOS, HTML5</p>
		<p><strong>Medium:</strong> iPad</p>
		<p>The Living Balance Sheet is an iPad app that allows Guardian Life Insurance brokers to create custom presentations based on the customer they are speaking with.</p>
		<p>The presentations are based on the traditional paper pamphlet that the salesperson usually uses but adds in animations and videos to help sell the Guardian Life Insurance products.</p>
